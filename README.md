# Mushin

A cross-platform files encryption application using AES-256 encryption. 

The files are encrypted safely by a securely generated private key. 

It can be decrypted by using the same private key to view the encrypted files.

Supports large files > 1GB. No file limits. Larger the file, longer it would take to encrypt or decrypt.

Tested it with pdf, docx, jpg, png, xls, csv, zip files. Should support other file formats as well.
