Files encryption and decryption service based on AES-256 encryption, built using Python, Flask API and Vue3.

The files are encrypted safely by a securely generated private key. 

It can be decrypted only by using the same private key to view the encrypted files.

## Benefits of using file encryption?

* Encryption and decryption based on AES-256 cryptography. 
* AES-256 is one of the highly secured protocols and makes it unbreakable to read the contents of encrypted files.
* Only available to decrypt and view the contents of files by the users who knows the private key.
* Safely share and secure your files with others.
* Protect your files from hackers or other intruders.
